animal_game
===========

A tutorial python script - A complete command line version of the animal game that is capable of (flawed) learning.

No dependencies other than python (2.7 or higher).

Just install the files or repo somewhere on your python path and invoke animal.py either directly from the command line or with 'python animal.py'.

It will attempt to save what it has learned to the local folder in animal_knowledge.pickle.
